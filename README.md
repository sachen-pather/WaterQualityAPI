## 🌊 Overview

The WaterQualityAPI provides endpoints for:
- Beach water quality monitoring
- Community discussions and posts
- PDF parsing for water quality reports
- Health monitoring and diagnostics

## 🚀 Live API

**Production URL:** https://waterqualityapi20250812142739.azurewebsites.net

### Quick Test Endpoints:
- Health Check: `/health`
- Beach Data: `/beach`
- API Documentation: `/swagger` (development only)
- Debug Info: `/debug/connection`

## 🛠 Technology Stack
